# Shift-Cypher-Encryption-Decryption
This C++ program takes in input from standard input, and takes in a number (which is the shift cypher) from the command line as an argument. It encrypts or decrypts the input by shifting each character by the shift cypher provided.
For Eg: If the first character of the input is "e", it encrypts the remanining input, and decrypts the remaining input if the first character is "d". If no argument is provided, then it encrypts the input by shifting each character 3 to the right.
